  <p>This section contains all things games.</p>
  <p>This section is also under construction, but writings will appear on here.. eventually. While this is under construction, have an assorted, unsorted list of games I love.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="lists">
  <ul class="nes-list is-disc">
    <li>Master of Orion 1 (1993) - One of the best turn based strategy games, ever released.</li>
    <li>Marble Blast Gold (2003) - A platformer I've played on and off for 10+ years. Simple but infinitely replayable.</li>
    <li>FTL: Faster Than Light (2012) - An excellent and a "tough-but-fair" indie roguelike, set in space!</li>
    <li>Dungeon Keeper 1 (1997) - "Its good to be bad".</li>
    <li>Europa Universalis IV (2013) - An great grand strategy game spanning late Medieval to early Modern ages. There's a reason I've sunk 1000+ hrs into this game.</li>
